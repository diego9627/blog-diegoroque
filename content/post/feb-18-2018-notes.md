# ML

Did a camelot tournament. Finished, but was kind of slow. It was a toy problem on trading.

# PyTorch

Played with pytorch. Looks interesting. 

# Optimization UROP

Read again the code. Reinstalled Coq, because otherwise I couldn't install compl_coq.
I ended up using Ocaml **4.04.0**, and installing Coq **8.06** using opam.

I will probably rework it so that I use more of the vector space stuff,
less ad hoc. Also write properly the parser for Haskell to JuMP.

# ReactML

Downloaded, started playing.

# 18.702

Started the problem set
