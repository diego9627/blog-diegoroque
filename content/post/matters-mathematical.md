This morning I was realizing my mathematical interests are, to put it mildldy, varied.
While I'm confident there's an underlying common aesthetics to them, this blog will be an attempt to concretize that. 

Among the things I'm very interested in are:

* Category Theory
    * Categorical Logic
* Algorithms
* Graph Theory
* Type Theory
* Automated/Assisted Theorem Proving
* Machine Learning
* Programming Language Research
* Functional Programming

Here are other things I think I should know about:

* Algebraic Topology
* Bitcoin
* Social Choice
* Networks

The name for the blog comes from "I am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General".
