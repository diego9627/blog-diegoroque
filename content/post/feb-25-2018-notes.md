# Optimization UROP

I realized that I was making the semantics for the macro level, because using `trace` wouldn't 
work unless I added an special operation. But JuMP doesn't have a special operation.
Hence the problem was working too high up.

I'll probably have to redo it working more low level, and then do the macro myself.

# 18.702

Finished the pset 3.
