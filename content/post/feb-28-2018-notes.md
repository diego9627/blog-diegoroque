# 18.S996

Philosophy: Actions speak louder than words. That is, people don't see beliefs but actions.

Two models: Sequential or iterative.

Proof of tamuz for iterative complete graph:

Proof of efficiency

Consider the point of view of outsider: No signal but watches all actions.

(This is called consensus voting.)

proof of convergence: check y per time, realize that the bounds for each x(i)
decreases, y=0 impossible

Exam

# Categorical Logic

Locales stuff and their relation to topological spaces. 
There's an adjoint that's almost an equivalence of categories. The equivalence 
is between spatial Locales and sober topological spaces.

There's also a localization between sober topological spaces and general
ones, as well as spatial locales and general ones. 
But while both lose information, localizing topological spaces 
delete nasty stuff and puts stuff that ought to be there,
while localizing locales might actually throw a lot of stuff you want out.

# 18.615

Finished pset. Kind of easy.
